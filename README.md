# Brain Mask 3D Segmentation Model üß†ü©ª

This repository contains a deep learning model for automatic 3D brain region segmentation from post-surgery CT scans. It supports downstream tasks like SEEG electrode localization and path reconstruction.

## Problem
Post-operative CT scans contain brain tissue with foreign elements like SEEG electrodes. Segmenting the brain helps isolate relevant anatomy for subsequent electrode detection.

## Methodology
- Framework: MONAI + PyTorch
- Model: 3D UNet
- Data: Post-operative CT scans from epilepsy patients
- Features:
  - CT normalization
  - Skull and bolt artifact removal (optional)
  - Dice + CrossEntropy loss
  - Patch-based training for GPU efficiency

## üìä Results
Achieved high overlap (Dice > 0.85) on test cases. Qualitative results show precise brain contouring despite bolt interference.
